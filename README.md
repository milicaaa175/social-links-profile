## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I practiced Flexbox and how to use it correctly. Also, classes were very useful for styling links (or buttons).

### Continued development

I want to be faster when writing code. Also I need to use Flexbox and Grid more, to get completely comfortable with them.

### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) - This helped me for learning Flexbox.
